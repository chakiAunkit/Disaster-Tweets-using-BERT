In this code, I uploaded my kaggle notebook where I fine-tuned BERT to classify tweets whether they are stating something related to a disaster or not. I recently took part in a kaggle competition, in which my model achieved an F1 score of 0.83665 and the rank was 101 out of 1300 teams. I have written a blog post for the same which can be found here: https://medium.com/@chaki18081999/fine-tuning-bert-to-classify-disaster-tweets-402b662c1b72
